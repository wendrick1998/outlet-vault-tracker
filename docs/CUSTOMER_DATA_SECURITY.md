# Customer Data Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to protect customer personal information and prevent data breaches.

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Purpose-Based Access Control
Customer data access is now controlled by specific business purposes:

- **`search_only`**: Minimal data for search results (name, registration status)
- **`general_view`**: Basic viewing with role-based data masking
- **`loan_processing`**: Contact info for loan operations (all access logged)
- **`administrative`**: Full access for admin tasks (heavily audited)

### 2. Role-Based Data Masking
- **Regular Users**: Only see customer name and registration status
- **Admins/Managers**: Full access to sensitive data with comprehensive audit logging

### 3. Comprehensive Audit Logging
All sensitive data access is logged with:
- User role and ID
- Access purpose and timestamp
- Specific fields accessed
- IP address (for administrative access)
- Unauthorized access attempts

### 4. Secure Database Functions
- `get_customer_secure()`: Single customer access with purpose control
- `get_customers_secure()`: List access with role-based filtering
- `search_customers_secure()`: Secure search without data exposure
- `get_registered_customers_secure()`: Registered customers with security

### 5. Service Layer Security
- `SecureCustomerService`: Type-safe service with proper JSONB handling
- `CustomerService`: Maintains API compatibility while using secure backend

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// General viewing (masked for regular users)
const customers = await CustomerService.getAll();

// Loan processing (contact info with logging)
const customer = await CustomerService.getForLoanProcessing(id);

// Administrative access (full data, heavily audited)
const customer = await CustomerService.getForAdministration(id);

// Secure search (role-based results)
const results = await CustomerService.searchByEmail(email);
```

## Security Benefits
1. **Data Breach Prevention**: Sensitive data is only accessible when necessary
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all sensitive data access
3. **Role-Based Security**: Access control based on business need
4. **Unauthorized Access Detection**: Logging of blocked access attempts
5. **Compliance Ready**: Audit logs support regulatory compliance

## Remaining Security Notes
- **Password Protection**: Enable leaked password protection in Supabase dashboard
- **Regular Audits**: Review audit logs regularly for suspicious activity
- **User Training**: Ensure admin users understand their data access responsibilities
